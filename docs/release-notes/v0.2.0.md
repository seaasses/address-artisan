## ✨ What Address Artisan Does

Generate vanity Bitcoin addresses with zero risk - uses only your xpub which cannot spend funds or expose private keys.

### Key Benefits

- **Use your existing wallet**: No need to generate new private keys for secure vanity addresses. The tool doesn't output any private keys either - no additional secrets to secure.
- **Completely safe**: xpub cannot be used to steal funds
- **Private keys stay secure**: To use the generated vanity address, private keys never leave your trusted wallet, whether it's a software or hardware wallet

### Comparison with Other Methods

| Method | Tool doesn't know private key | Uses existing wallet | Private key stays in wallet |
|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| **Address Artisan** (xpub) | ✅ Yes - completely safe | ✅ Yes - just change path | ✅ Yes - never leaves |
| **Split-key** (e.g., VanitySearch) | ✅ Yes - safe to outsource | ❌ No - new wallet setup | ❌ No - need to calculate new key |
| **Traditional** (e.g., vanitygen) | ❌ No - generates it | ❌ No - new wallet setup | ❌ No - generated externally |

### Key Features

- **CPU Multi-Threading**: Auto-detects physical cores by default
- **GPU Acceleration**: OpenCL-based GPU support for NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel GPUs
- **Dual Address Types**: Works with both Legacy (1...) and Native SegWit (bc1q...) addresses
- **Multiple Prefix Search**: Search multiple prefixes simultaneously - mix Legacy and SegWit prefixes in a single search

```bash
# Example: search for multiple prefixes of different types
address-artisan --xpub xpub6D... --prefix 1TEST bc1qmyname 1seaasses
```
