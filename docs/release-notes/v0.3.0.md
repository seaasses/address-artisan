# Release v0.3.0 - November 22, 2025

## 🎯 Highlights

Address Artisan v0.3.0 introduces the `--num-addresses` option, giving you control over batch generation. Instead of being limited to a single address, you can now generate as many matching addresses as you need in one run. This release also brings documentation improvements, making it easier for new users to get started.

## ✨ What's New

### Generate Multiple Addresses with `--num-addresses`

Generate multiple matching addresses in a single run with the new `--num-addresses` option. Previously, the tool would stop after finding one match - now you can specify exactly how many you need.

**Example:**

```bash
# Generate exactly 10 addresses with prefix "1A" or "bc1qa"
address-artisan --xpub <xpub> --prefix 1A bc1qa --num-addresses 10

# Short form with -n
address-artisan --xpub <xpub> --prefix 1A bc1qa -n 10
```

**Use case:** When you need multiple vanity addresses for a project - like generating 100 addresses for a wallet service or creating a batch for testing - you can now get them all in one run instead of running the command multiple times.

**Performance:** No performance impact - the tool runs at the same speed and automatically stops after reaching your target count.
