## ✨ What's New

### 🎨 Terminal User Interface (TUI)

The new TUI observer transforms address generation monitoring from plain text logs into a rich, interactive terminal experience.

**Key Features:**

- **📊 Structured Table View**: Address information displayed in a clean table format with clearly defined columns
- **⌨️ Interactive Navigation**: Use `Tab` and arrow keys to scroll through addresses and workbenches when content exceeds screen space
- **🖥️ Multi-Device Support**: Navigate between workbenches when using multiple GPUs or devices
- **🎯 Better Organization**: Header, content, and footer sections clearly separated
- **🚀 Zero Performance Impact**: Visual improvements don't affect generation speed

### Usage

The TUI observer is now the default output method. When running Address Artisan, the terminal will automatically switch to TUI mode when displaying results:

```bash
address_artisan --prefix 1ABC --xpub <xpub>
```

**Interactive Controls:**

- **Tab**: Switch focus between different sections (workbenches, addresses)
- **Arrow Keys (↑/↓)**: Scroll through addresses when the list exceeds screen space
- **Arrow Keys (←/→)**: Navigate between workbenches when multiple GPU devices are active
- **Ctrl + C**: Stop the application

The interface automatically handles overflow - if you find many matching addresses or have multiple GPUs running, simply use the navigation keys to explore all the data. When you stop the application or it completes, all found addresses are printed to the terminal for easy access.

No configuration changes needed - the improved interface just works!
