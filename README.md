# Address Artisan

Address Artisan is a vanity Bitcoin P2PKH address generator based on the [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) xpub key derivation.

This software is inspired by [Senzu](https://github.com/kaiwolfram/senzu) and aims to be:

- ðŸ”’ **Secure**: using BIP32 key derivation you can generate vanity addresses for your hardware wallet! ðŸ¤¯
- âš¡ **Fast**: match recognition algorithm that does not require the checksum calculation.

- ðŸ˜Ž **Cool**: "1There1sNoSpoon" is much cooler than "bc1qtheresn0sp00n". P2PKH for the win! ðŸŽ‰
